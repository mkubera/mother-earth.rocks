A sequential. Story planned to span over about 10 issues.
<br>

### Cover art idea
![The Empire - cover idea](images/empire-cover_idea.png)

### Description
A fictional reality... <br />
Planets (known as _Mothers_) give birth to one another. <br />
Humanity travels between the Mothers via artifically sustained umbilical cords. <br />
An empire (ruling a significant portion of the universe) is itself ruled by less than 1% of its society. <br />
People, whose skin is but a dance of black &amp; white wiggly shapes, known as _Dreamers_ live in huts brought forth from their own dreams in back-to-the-basics style communities, hiding on the outskirts of the empire. <br />
They are the empire's greatest threat: free-spirited, peace-loving, capable of delivering visions that produce lasting, perception-altering changes in whoever receives them.
<br>

### Issue #1
Divided into two parts (each ~25 pages long): <br />
Part 1: Taxes <br />
Part 2: Thanatos, or Death <br />

It's a play on _two sure things in life_. <br />

__Part one__ is a curious tour of the empire conducted by a personification of Taxation who reflects on the empire through his own prism (i.e. the omnipresent existence of taxation in the imperial citizens' lives). <br />

__Part two__ focuses solely on a dream village being raided by a small unit of imperial troops. A fight between the forces of physical violence and metaphysical touch &mdash; something likely never experienced by readers before.
