### :who
__What Makes Us Human__ (hiding under the graceful url _mother-earth.rocks_, for _whatmakesushuman_ domains were all but taken) is an independent publisher of sequential art and, quite possibly, other media in the future.

### :why
We bring __What Makes Us Human__ to existence because we feel, very strongly, that most of humankind has forgotten how to live in harmony with the world. This world that feeds us, that astonishes us, that we are so interwovenly part of that to distinguish between human and nature is quite impossible. Just like other mammals, we have bones and muscles, we bleed, we love, we reason (although too often quite differently), and we're capable of recognizing wisdom and harmony of the world. That's how we feel.
As artists, we want to express the natural, the mystical, the required to change &mdash; to awaken, to reopen ourselves to Mother Earth. To reconnect. To tell stories that will turn our focus away from corporate entertainment; from (too often) selective and failing to inform us about our follies news presented by the mainstream media; and from the education that teaches us how the Old World Europeans _discovered_ Americas (rather than tell us about the genocide, the rape & the destruction of cultures), and tells us  how civilization makes the world and humans great (while indigenous peoples from different continents inform us & show us that cancer is civilization-caused (a tip-of-the-iceberg example, really)).

The list of "whys" is too long to fully index here. But we will strive to create art that heals and entertainment that encourages contemplation for a new generation of us &mdash; humans &mdash; those who are not too afraid or too ignorant to learn that if we don't change our ways, we will simply perish. And the means to change our ways is to rediscover the exuberance and the beauty of our own humanity. To contemplate. To adore. To wonder. To ask: __What Makes Us Human__?

### :when & :where
June 2016. In Scotland, but our existence spans the web. Or _the webs_. The digital, and the web of Life.
